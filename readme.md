# Decide… pizza or cats?

_Would you live in a world without pizzas or without cat memes? You vote. Other people vote. The majority decides._

# The game
PizzaVersusCats is a card game.
You have five cards in your hand; each one could represent anything.
Let’s say you have a _rainbow_, _Ariana Grande_, a _mushroom_, a _cat_, and _Paolo Brosio_.
Your opponent plays a card showing a _pizza_, and you decide to fight it using your _cat_ card.
Then, the game tells you that the winner is...

### More details ...
You start with five cards.
At each round, everyone plays a card in sequential order, and the game tells you which one is the best.
The cards used in the round go in the main deck.
The player who played the best card does not pick a new one, while the other players must take a new card from the main deck.
The winner is the first one remaining without cards.

Which cards are in the game?
The community decides which cards are in the game by adding pictures in a shared database.

How PizzaVersusCats knows which card is stronger?
An algorithm gives a ranking to each card using players answers to “this or that questions”.
Indeed, before or after each match, a user must answer questions about couples of cards randomly chosen from the cards database.
For instance: Pizza or cat memes? Coke or Pepsi? Java or C++? Pippo Baudo or Paolo Brosio?
You vote, and PizzaVersusCats remembers all the votes and ranks all the cards!
